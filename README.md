Note on AI usage: AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini) were used 
to explore layout and styling ideas. I was unhappy with my visual looks when I tried using it iniaily.
I referenced some of their suggested HTML and Bootstrap class suggestions, but adapted them to my own approach and made 
adjustments where the AIâ€™s suggestions were imperfect. The final 
implementation reflects my own design choices. Moreover, AI was used to help debug
some annoying errors I had with my network and routing between pages. I used an app called
Prettyify to make my html cleaner and more readable.
